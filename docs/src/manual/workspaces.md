# Workspaces

The Snow user interface has a 'workspace' concept. You can load and save
workspaces from the 'Workspace' menu.

The following things are saved into a workspace file and restored when you
load it:

 * The emulated machine type and selected ROMs
 * The mounted SCSI HDDs
 * The open windows, their position and size
 * The configured display scale and whether the viewport is vertically centered
